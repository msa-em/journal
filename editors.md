## Editor-in-Chief

`Colin Ophus` is a staff scientist at NCEM, part of the [Molecular Foundry](https://foundry.lbl.gov/), at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). He runs both a research group and user program focused on methods, algorithms, and codes for simulation, analysis and instrument design for STEM and TEM. He has received a US DOE Early Career award (2018) and was awarded the [Burton Medal](https://www.microscopy.org/awards/bios/burton_physical_2022.cfm) from the Microscopy Society of America (2022). He is project leader for the [Prismatic](https://prism-em.com/) STEM simulation and [py4DSTEM](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM) open-source codes. (cophus@gmail.com)

## Editorial Board

`Beth Dickey` is the Department Head and Teddy and Wilton Hawkins Distinguished Professor of the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html) department at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/). She is a Fellow of the Microscopy Society of America and of the American Ceramic Society, and is a member of the World Academy of Ceramics. (ecdickey@cmu.edu)

## Technology

The Elemental Microscopy journal was developed by the [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/mission) team and built with open source [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) components.

`Rowan Cockett` is the CEO and co-founder of [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com), which is an interactive, online writing and publishing platform for science, with dedicated integrations to Jupyter. Rowan is a core developer of [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) and has a Ph.D. in computational geophysics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) where he worked on large-scale simulation and parameter estimation package for geophysical processes (electromagnetics, fluid-flow, gravity, etc.).

The larger [Curvenote team](https://curvenote.com/mission) including `Steve Purves`, `Franklin Koch` and `Mike Morrison` have been in involved in the design and development of Elemental Microscopy.
