## Editors

`Colin Ophus` is an Associate Professor in the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), and a Center Fellow at the [Precourt Institute for Energy](https://energy.stanford.edu/). 
He was formerly a staff scientist at the [National Center for Electron Microscopy](https://foundry.lbl.gov/about/facilities/the-national-center-for-electron-microscopy-ncem/), part of the [Molecular Foundry](https://foundry.lbl.gov/), at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). 
He researches experimental methods, reconstruction algorithms, and data analysis for S/TEM. 
He has received a US DOE Early Career award (2018) and was awarded the [Burton Medal](https://www.microscopy.org/awards/bios/burton_physical_2022.cfm) from the Microscopy Society of America (2022). 
He is project leader for the [Prismatic](https://prism-em.com/) STEM simulation and [py4DSTEM](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM) open-source codes. 
He is the founding editor-in-chief for `Elemental Microscopy`.

`Georgios Varnavides` is a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu/) postdoctoral researcher working at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. 
His research interests lie in developing new computational imaging modalities to observe the structure and function of materials at high resolution and sensitivity.
He is one of the core developers of the phase-retrieval modules in the [py4DSTEM](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM) open-source code.
He is the technology editor for `Elemental Microscopy`, with extensive experience in using web-based open-source tools for pedagogy and science-communication.

## Technology

The Elemental Microscopy journal was developed by the [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/mission) team and built with open source [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) components.

`Rowan Cockett` is the CEO and co-founder of [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com), which is an interactive, online writing and publishing platform for science, with dedicated integrations to Jupyter. 
Rowan is a core developer of [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) and has a Ph.D. in computational geophysics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) where he worked on large-scale simulation and parameter estimation package for geophysical processes (electromagnetics, fluid-flow, gravity, etc.).

The larger [Curvenote team](https://curvenote.com/mission) including `Steve Purves`, `Franklin Koch`, and `Mike Morrison` have been in involved in the design and development of Elemental Microscopy.
