Interactivity
: One major benefit of publusing in `Elemental Microscopy` is that you can publish experimental data using **highly interactive figures**. These include:

- **Images** where you can zoom in, change the contrast levels, flip between channels such as raw and processed, modify colormaps, and overlay additional information.

- **Movies** embedded directly in the text with the ability to play back at any speed, show live analysis, and all of the other interactive options available for images.

- **Plotting Data** which can be expanded to show statistics, sources of input data and error bars, and correlation between channels. 

- **3D Volumes** with control over the viewing direction and magnification, isosurface levels, slice positions, and embedded measuremenets.


, `Elemental Microscopy` offer an opportunity to develop a theme in greater detail than is possible in a traditional journal article, yet more concisely than would be expected in a full-length book.


Code
: Built on the Jupyter Book publishing platform and MyST markdown language, `Elemental Microscopy` articles can include Jupyter notebooks which reproduce visualization, analysis, and simulation workflows. Authors can save time by publishing notebooks directly rather than rewriting into LaTeX or Word formats, and then typesetting into journal-specific formats.


Flexibility
: With lengths of approximately 5,000â€“30,000 words, `Elemental Microscopy` offer an opportunity to develop a theme in greater detail than is possible in a traditional journal article, yet more concisely than would be expected in a full-length book.


Preprints and Peer Review
: You can publish the initial version of a scientific paper on the `Elemental Microscopy` platform, marked as a preprint version. EM articles will then go through a peer review process. After passing this review, accepted articles will have the preprint label removed and have all referee reports attached to the paper. Reviewers may opt to publish their names alongside their review, or remain anonymous.


Open Access
: All `Elemental Microscopy` articles will be published under a CC BY 4.0 open access license. Each article will contain not only the code required to produce all results and figures, but also inline links to raw data and source code repositories.
